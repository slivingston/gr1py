gr1py
=====

**gr1py** is an enumerative (or concrete) reactive synthesis tool for the GR(1)
fragment of LTL. It is pure Python.


Installation
------------

Releases are available from the `Python Package Index
<https://pypi.org/>`_ at https://pypi.org/project/gr1py/
To get it from there and check the version, try ::

  pip install gr1py
  gr1py -V

`pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_ should get dependencies for you if you do not have
them. They are

* PLY (https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/)

If it is available, NetworkX (https://networkx.org/) will be used.
However, it is not required.  A simple built-in class for directed graphs will
be used if NetworkX is not found.

If you want to hack on gr1py, clone the repository from

Examples
--------

Besides the Python package, a script named ``gr1py`` is installed that provides
access to several routines from the command-line. Consider the file named
examples/arbiter3.spc that is included in the source release. To check that the
specification defined by it can be realized, try ::

  gr1py -r examples/arbiter3.spc

To synthesize a winning strategy and dump it in the Graphviz DOT format, try ::

  gr1py -t dot examples/arbiter3.spc > arbiter3-fsm.dot
  dot -Tsvg -O arbiter3-fsm.dot

where the second command uses the program ``dot`` (part of Graphviz) to create
an SVG file, likely named arbiter3-fsm.dot.svg; e.g., the file can be displayed
using a Web browser or Inkscape.

A summary of command-line usage can be obtained by ``grpy -h``.


Input formats
-------------

The default input format is that of gr1c (http://scottman.net/2012/gr1c).


Output formats
--------------

These are selected from the command-line using the ``-t`` switch.  Each
corresponds to a function in ``gr1py.output``.

* ``json`` : `gr1c JSON <https://tulip-control.github.io/gr1c/md_formats.html#gr1cjson>`_
* ``dot`` : `Graphviz dot <https://www.graphviz.org>`_
